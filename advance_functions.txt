1. Security & Permissions (High Priority)
While you have login/logout, a NAS needs proper file access control.

A. File Deletion and Renaming (CRUD Completion)
You can browse and upload, but you need the "D" (Delete) and "U" (Update/Rename) operations.

Implement delete_file View: A view and a corresponding button (with a strong confirmation modal) to securely delete files and folders.

Implement rename_file View: A view to rename a file or folder directly from the drive_content.html page.

B. User Permissions (ACL Simulation)
Since it's a personal NAS, you might not need complex group permissions, but you should enforce basic security.

Restrict Access: Ensure all file manipulation views (upload_file, drive_content, disk_status, and the new delete_file/rename_file views) use the @login_required decorator in your views.py.

Prevent Path Traversal: In your file/folder browsing logic, rigorously sanitize the path parameter to ensure users cannot navigate outside the intended NAS root directory (e.g., prevent paths like ../../../../etc/passwd).

2. Maintenance & System Health (Medium Priority)
Extend the data you gather beyond simple disk space.

A. Basic System Monitoring (Dashboard)
Enhance your dashboard or disk_status.html to show real-time metrics.

CPU/RAM Usage: Display the current CPU load percentage and RAM usage (Total, Used, Free). This is crucial for diagnosing performance issues.

Temperature: If you are using a Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer, display the CPU temperature to prevent overheating.

Uptime: Show how long the NAS server process has been running.

B. Logs and Error Reporting
Provide visibility into what the system is doing.

View Log Files: Implement a simple view to display the last 50-100 lines of your main server log file (or a simplified application log).

3. Advanced Usability (Future Improvements)
These features take your manager from functional to genuinely useful.

A. Search Functionality
If you have a large number of files, manual browsing is inefficient.

File Search: Implement a search bar on the drive_content.html page to allow users to search for files or folders by name (a simple recursive search through the filesystem).

B. File Viewing & Preview
Direct interaction with files without downloading them.

Text/Code Viewer: For files smaller than a certain size (e.g., <1MB) and with recognized extensions (.txt, .log, .json), implement a view that streams the content to the browser instead of forcing a download.

Image Gallery: If browsing a folder full of images, create a simple view to show thumbnails or a carousel preview.

C. File Management Utilities
Tools to simplify common tasks.

Compression/Extraction: Add buttons to zip or unzip folders directly on the server side (e.g., using Python's zipfile module).

File Hashing/Integrity Check: Display the MD5 or SHA-256 hash of a file on its info page for integrity verification.
